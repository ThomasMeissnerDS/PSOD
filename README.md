# Pseudo-supervised outlier detection

> A highly performant alternative to purely unsupervised approaches.

PSOD uses supervised methods to identify outliers in unsupervised contexts. It offers higher accuracy for outliers
with top scores than other models while keeping comparable performance on the whole dataset.

The repo contains example notebooks. Please note that example notebooks do not always contain the newest version. 
The file psod.py is always the most updated one.
